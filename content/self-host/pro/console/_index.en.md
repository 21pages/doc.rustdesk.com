## Windows EXE
For Windows clients, you can leave out the custom server configuration and put the configuration information in the `RustDesk.exe` filename instead. As shown above, please go to the console welcome page and click on `Windows EXE`. **`Client >=1.1.9 Required`**ã€‚

## Device access permissions
There are two ways to associate a device with a user:
- Via console device page
- Log in to the specified user account on the client side

The following two situations will prevent the device from being accessed:
- Make device `disabled` in console devices page
- Make user `disable` in console user page

The associated device can only be accessed by user devices of the same user or user group, or in correct cross-group settings.
