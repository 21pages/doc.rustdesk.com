## I have installed RustDesk Server Pro manually but the API web console isn't behind SSL, how can I secure this?
Use a proxy like nginx, the simple install script has one, its really simple [[https://github.com/dinger1986/rustdesk-server-pro](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server-pro)/blob/493ad90daf8815c3052ff4d0d4aa9cc07e411efa/install.sh#L252](this is how we did it).

Similar configs should work with Traefikv2, HAProxy, Apache Proxy and Cloudflare Tunnel.
